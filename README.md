This is my vim configuration. 
To set up a new system:

Linux:
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/dgurchenkov/vimconfig.git .vim

Windows:
cd c:\\Users\$username
git clone https://github.com/dgurchenkov/vimconfig.git vimfiles

That's it, Vim should pick up ~/.vim/vimrc as the config file, and plug-ins from ~/.vim/ as well
